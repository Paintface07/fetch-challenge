# fetch-challenge

A Spring application to demonstrate the following functionality:
> Please write a web service that takes in a string and returns a boolean to indicate whether a word is a pyramid word.
> A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing
> without gaps and without duplicates.
>
> Examples:
> banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
> bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
>
> You can use any language and when completed, please upload to a public repository and provide us with the link.

For this application, I will be using the following technologies to demonstrate this functionality:
* Language - Java - Utilized because I am most familiar with this language and can develop quickly in it.
* Web Framework - Spring Boot - Utilized to quicken development of a RESTful web service.
* Build Tool - Maven - Utilized to simplify creation of a runnable JAR.
